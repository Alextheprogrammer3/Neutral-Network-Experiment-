```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 100
num_classes = 10

X_train = np.random.random((num_samples, num_features))
y_train = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_samples)

X_val = np.random.random((num_samples, num_features))
y_val = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_samples)

# Define the model with dropout
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(num_features,)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=20, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
print(f'Validation Loss: {loss}')

### **Final**
Thank you for taking the time to review this project on neural network experimentation and insights.

While the results may not have met the initial expectations, the experience has been incredibly valuable. It has provided numerous learning opportunities, from understanding the intricacies of model complexity and data quality to grappling with the challenges of hyperparameter tuning.
Dataset Impact
The project utilized synthetic data from the following paths:

/kaggle/input/cspdarknet/keras/csp_darknet_tiny/2
/kaggle/input/cspdarknet/keras/csp_darknet_l/2
Synthetic data often lacks the variability and complexity of real-world data. This limitation affected the model's performance in several ways:

Limited Data Diversity: Synthetic data may not encompass the diverse patterns found in real-world scenarios, making it difficult for the model to generalize effectively.

Overfitting: The model might have overfitted to the synthetic data's specific patterns rather than learning generalizable features.

Inadequate Challenge: The lack of real-world complexities meant the model did not face the varied and unpredictable data it would encounter in practical applications.

These factors likely contributed to the model's suboptimal performance, as reflected in the high validation loss and low accuracy.

## **Learning Experience**
This project has highlighted the critical role of high-quality, diverse datasets in model training and evaluation. Moving forward, using more realistic data will be crucial for improving model performance and gaining more accurate insights.

Thank you again for your time and feedback.
